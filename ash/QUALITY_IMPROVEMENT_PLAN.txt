Quality Improvement Plan for FreeCol

Target Areas:
1. Colony subsystem – food, growth, and production checks
2. Goods subsystem – production amounts and consumption logic
3. Market subsystem – price update calculations
4. Map subsystem – tile visibility and seasonal changes
5. SeasonManager feature – seasonal effects on production

Improvement Types:
- Add unit tests
- Add integration tests
- Fix static analysis issues (SonarLint, CheckStyle)
- Refactor high-complexity methods
- Improve Javadocs where missing

Justification:
- These systems run every turn and can cause major gameplay issues
- Seasonal effects require stable production and visibility logic
- Good candidates for testing, refactoring, and documentation improvements
