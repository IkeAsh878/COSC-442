Quality Improvement Plan for FreeCol

Target Areas:
1. Colony subsystem – population, growth, production
2. Goods subsystem – goods amounts, production amounts
3. Market subsystem – buying/selling price changes
4. Map coordinate system – coordinate validation
5. Game turn system – for new Seasonal Weather feature
6. SeasonManager feature – ensure clean design and testability

Improvement Types:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Refactoring
- Javadocs
- Static analysis (SonarLint, CheckStyle)

Justification:
- High complexity areas
- Core gameplay importance
- Frequent execution (production, map lookup)
- Good candidate for testing
