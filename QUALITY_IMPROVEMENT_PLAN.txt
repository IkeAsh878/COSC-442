Quality Improvement Plan for FreeCol

Target Areas:
1. Colony subsystem – population, growth, production.
2. Goods subsystem – goods amounts and production amounts.
3. Market subsystem – buying/selling and price changes.
4. Map coordinate system – coordinate validation and lookup.
5. Game turn system – needed to support the new Seasonal Weather feature.
6. SeasonManager feature – ensure clean design and testability.

Improvement Types:
- Add unit tests to cover core model logic.
- Add integration tests for multi-class behaviors.
- Refactor long or complex methods into smaller helpers.
- Add missing Javadocs for public methods.
- Use static analysis tools (SonarLint, CheckStyle) to find and fix code smells and style issues.

Justification:
- The targeted areas are important for core gameplay (Colony, Goods, Market).
- These classes are executed frequently, so defects are more visible to players.
- Their complexity makes them good candidates for refactoring and additional tests.
- The new Seasonal Weather feature must be reliable, so it needs tests and simple design.
