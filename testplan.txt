Testing and QA Plan for FreeCol

Test Goals:
- Increase confidence in key gameplay systems.
- Reduce the likelihood of regressions in production, growth, and trade.
- Ensure the new Seasonal Weather feature behaves correctly.

Unit Tests to Add:
- ColonyGrowthTest: verify that colony population does not become negative and reacts to food levels.
- GoodsProductionTest: verify that goods, especially food, do not drop unexpectedly when producing.
- SeasonManagerTest: verify season cycling and production multipliers.

Integration Tests to Add:
- Seasonal production: confirm that the season multiplier changes how much a colony produces each turn.
- Market price behavior: confirm that repeated buying and selling changes prices in a predictable way.
- Save/load cycle: confirm that saving and loading keeps game state consistent (planned).

Tools:
1. SonarLint:
   - Run on the project.
   - Fix all Critical and Major issues in:
     - Colony.java
     - Market.java
     - Map.java

2. CheckStyle:
   - Apply a standard Java style.
   - Fix issues related to spacing, naming, unused imports, and formatting.

Coverage Targets:
- Aim for at least 70% line coverage in selected classes:
  - Colony
  - Market
  - SeasonManager
- Ensure all new feature code and new tests run without failures.
